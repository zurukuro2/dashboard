# Cryptocurrency Icons

[This project](http://cryptoicons.co) contains over 2000 icons – [330 crypto, and fiat currencies](Coin%20List.md), in 4 styles and a range of sizes. Completely free. All I ask is that you don’t claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

Images are in the PNG format (transparent) in 32×32, 64×64(@2x), and 128×128 variants, along with SVG versions.

If there is an altcoin you’re looking for that hasn’t been included, please create a new issue.


## Install 🚀

```
$ npm install cryptocurrency-icons
```

You can then import the icons from `./node_modules/cryptocurrency-icons`, for example `./node_modules/cryptocurrency-icons/svg/color/kmd.svg`.
